# ResNet-for-Tiny-Imagenet

This project is to create a full pre-activation ResNet architecture for the Tiny Imagenet dataset to evaluate the validation accuracy.

### About the Dataset:
Tiny Imagenet is a smaller version of the Imagenet Dataset with 100,000 images and 200 classes, i.e 500 images per class. Each image is of the size 64x64 and has classes like [ Cat, Slug, Puma, School Bus, Nails, Goldfish etc. ]. For Validation, we have 10,000 images of size 64x64 with 50 images per class. Most of the images for testing are extremely difficult to recognize the class even with the naked eye.
